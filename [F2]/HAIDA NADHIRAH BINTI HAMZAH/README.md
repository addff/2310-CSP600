# Chapter 1 Introduction
## Project Statement

### Issue
  One major issue about school transportation is the lack of real-time monitoring capabilities in traditional school transport systems, leading to potential inaccuracies and safety concerns. This limitation can pose challenges for ensuring the safety and security of students during their commute to and from school.

### Evidence
- Parents with elementary schoolchildren reported that 31 percent worry about safe passage to and from school, according to a study released by University of Michigan Health.

- Traditional school transport systems lacking real-time monitoring capabilities, which can lead to potential inaccuracies and safety concerns.
- Parents can track their children along the bus route in real time, and the system provides additional security features such as access to safety records of bus/vehicle drivers and infringements.

### Problem Identification
1. Inadequate Safety Measures in Traditional School Transportation Systems
2. Lack of Transparency Between School Bus Operations and Parents throughout their child's daily commute
3. Limited Access to Real-Time Journey Updates for Parents

### Solution
To develop a mobile application with a user-friendly interface that allows parents to track their child's school bus in real time. Using RFID technology, parents are automatically notified when their child boards the bus and arrives at the school. Additionally, GPS tracking enables parents to track the school bus's location throughout the journey, ensuring that the bus remains within designated areas.
