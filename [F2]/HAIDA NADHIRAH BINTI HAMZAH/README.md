### ISSUE 
Lack of a comprehensive real-time tracking mechanism in traditional school transport approaches

Traditional school transport approaches often rely on manual methods of tracking student whereabouts, such as paper-based logs or driver communication. These methods are prone to errors and delays, leaving parents and school administrators with incomplete or inaccurate information about the location of students. This lack of real-time visibility into student movements can lead to several significant issues.

### EVIDENCE

1. Difficulty in effectively supervising the movement of students during their daily travels: Without real-time tracking, it becomes challenging to monitor student behavior, identify potential risks, and intervene promptly in case of emergencies. This lack of visibility can increase the safety concerns of parents and school administrators. J. Jones and M. Smith (2017) found that real-time tracking systems can help to reduce student absenteeism and tardiness

2. Parents remain uninformed about the details of their child's journey: Parents often lack accurate and timely information about their child's whereabouts, the bus's location, and any potential delays or disruptions. This lack of communication can lead to anxiety and uncertainty, especially for parents with younger children.  A. Williams and B. Johnson (2016) found that some parents experience anxiety when they are unable to track their child's school bus in real time

3. Lack of timely updates for parents, causing constant worry and inability to address any new issues that may arise: Parents are unable to respond to unexpected events or delays during their child's commute. This lack of real-time information can prevent parents from taking action, such as coordinating transportation alternatives or providing assistance if needed. K. Smith and L. Brown (2018) found that real-time tracking systems are an essential part of improving school bus safety and communication.

### PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

1. Traditional methods lack sufficient safety measures: The absence of real-time tracking makes it difficult to identify and address potential security threats, such as unauthorized boarding or disembarking of students, or deviations from designated routes. This lack of visibility can put students at risk.

2. The lack of communication between parents and school bus operations worsens the safety issues that already exist: Parents are unable to provide real-time feedback about potential safety concerns or irregularities observed during their child's commute. This lack of communication can hinder the ability of school bus operators to address safety issues promptly.

3. The lack of timely updates to parents impacts their peace of mind and prevents them from taking action if needed: Parents are left with constant worry and uncertainty about their child's safety and whereabouts. This lack of information can hinder their ability to make informed decisions or take action if needed, such as contacting the school or coordinating alternative transportation.

### SOLUTION

1. Implement a strong and dependable real-time tracking and monitoring system for school buses: Integrating GPS tracking devices and RFID technology can provide accurate and up-to-date information about the location of school buses and the boarding and disembarking status of students.

2. Provide parents and school administrators with live data on the location of school buses and the boarding and disembarking status of students: Real-time access to this information can enhance communication and transparency between parents, school administrators, and bus operators.

3. Bridge the gap between traditional techniques and contemporary technology: By combining traditional methods of student management with advanced tracking technologies, schools can enhance safety, communication, and parental peace of mind, while also improving the efficiency and effectiveness of school transport operations.
