# Chapter 1 Introduction

## Project Statement

### Issue

No exisiting safety applications with efficient features to make sure users are safe

### Evidence

* 20 applications that have been analysed, only 6 applications (30%) provide emergency recording.
* Based on the application analysis, only 1 out of 20 applications (5%) has panic button that is easily acesss either as a widget on homescreen or from lockscreen.
* 15 out of 20 applications (75%) do not alert users or provide feature of showing dangerous spots around the city.

### Problem Identification

* Current safety applications lack of tools to produce admissible evidence for police cases.
* No easily accessible panic button in exisiting safety applications.
* Existing safety applications do not alert users about dangerous spots in the city.

### Solution

* Automatic video recording with anto-tempering implementation during emergency
* Essential information will be send to trusted person and user nearby when easily accessible ‘Panic Button’ activated
* Maps shows real-time potentially dangerous cases with alert using geofencing
