# Chapter 1 Introduction
## Project Statement

### Issue
Nowadays, most running apps overlook the importance of weather and running route selection in runners overall performance and well being. This results in problems for runners to locate local running routes, no personalization for running route recommendation, and lack of weather data availability.

### Evidence
Basic fact either observation, questionaire, interview, article

1. According to the questionnaire, runners usually plan their running route by   
   themselves because they find it difficult to discover new running routes.
2. According to a study by Karahanoglu et al. (2021), most fitness trackers may not 
   openly track the weather as weather is one of the critical factors that impact 
   running performance.
3. According to a study by Karahanoglu et al. (2021), regardless how skilled a runner 
   is, whether they are beginners or professional runners, they value having access to 
   personalized guide, data, and feedback to help them assess their performance and 
   personal targets.

### Problem Identification
1. Lack of running application that recommends local running routes near runner's area.
2. Challenges in finding local running routes according to runners preferences.
3. Lack of weather data integration in running applications.

### Solution
1. Develop a mobile application that identifies nearby local running routes.
2. Locating local running routes according to runners preferences.
3. Develop a mobile application that provides weather forecasts.
