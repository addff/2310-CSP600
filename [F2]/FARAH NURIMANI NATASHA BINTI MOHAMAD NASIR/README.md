# Chapter 1 Introduction
## Project Statement

### Issue
Nowadays not everyone can afford a personal coach to help them in their running training. Most online platforms provide generic and rigid running plans which makes it challenging for runners to incorporate their running plans to their schedule which affects their running consistency. Besides, runners struggle to locate running routes, especially ones that are nearby and tailored to their preferences.

### Evidence
Basic fact either observation, questionaire, interview, article

1. Hoppe (2020) stated that, runners who cannot afford to have custom made running plans need to be aware that running plans they obtained from other sources like on the Internet are produced to be used by everyone.
2. According to Davie, the disadvantages of Strava’s running plan is that the default day of the beginning of the running plan is always Monday and it is unalterable according to his preference. He also said that he needs to strictly follow what plans the app provides and incorporate his schedule based on the running plan. (Medium, 2023).
3. According to a study by Karahanoglu et al. (2021), regardless how skilled a runner is, whether they are beginners or professional runners, they value having access to personalized guide, data, and feedback to help them assess their performance and personal targets.
4. According to the questionnaire, runners usually plan their running route by themselves because they find it difficult to discover new running routes.

### Problem Identification
1. Most online platforms do not offer enough personalization and flexibility in running plans provided.
2. Lack of running application that recommends local running routes near runner’s area.

### Solution
1. Develop a mobile application that provides running plans according to runners preferences.
2. Develop a mobile application that identifies local running routes based on users’ location.
3. Applying a recommender system, where users can answer “preference-setting" questions and get tailored running plans and routes.
