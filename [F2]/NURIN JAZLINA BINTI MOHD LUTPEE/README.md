2. The patient forgets appointments and neglects to take medication as recommended(Saboo, 2021). Based on the survey conducted, 69.7% of the 33 respondents forgot their appointment. This is a significant percentage, and it suggests that there is a need for better systems for reminding people about their appointments.

This refusal often stems from a lack of awareness on behalf of the mental patient themselves, who may remain oblivious to their condition. If they have the symptoms and fail to seek assistance promptly, their mental health conditions will deteriorate and potentially leading to severe consequences.
2. Currently people busy with work tend to forget to attend appointments and track their medication. The individual has booked the appointment but is busy with work etc, then they forgot their appointment.
3. Costly and time-consuming procedures will lead to risks the individuals with mental health issues. The rural residential might not have the nearest clinic or counselling centre.
