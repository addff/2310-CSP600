# Chapter 1 Introduction
## Project Statement
### Issue
Nowadays, wedding organizers promote their services on a variety of online platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok because there is no existing mobile application for wedding organizers that allows users to browse all available options in one place. Therefore, clients find it challenging to locate wedding organizers in their specific area.

### Evidence
1. Regarding the difficulty of comparing wedding planners and their services, almost three-quarters of those responding to the survey (73.3%) agreed with the statement. This agreement has likely been impacted by the fact that not everyone has highly developed internet information-gathering skills. It indicates that some people might find it challenging to efficiently navigate different online platforms in order to discover more about various wedding organizers, which would make it difficult for them to make wise comparisons.

2. Around 80 percent of those who took the survey agreed that it is difficult for them to find out if certain dates have already been reserved by someone else. This challenge is caused by the requirement that reservations be made in person at the organizer's office. This high agreement percentage highlights the inconvenience and time waste that almost all of clients experience when they are not able to readily confirm date availability without visiting the location in person, leading to a systemic problem with existing booking process. The findings highlight the need for a more effective and user-friendly reservation system.

3. 54.7% of those who took the survey acknowledged that contacting wedding organizers via current online medium shows difficulties. This percentage shows that a significant number of the respondents had trouble communicating. These difficulties could manifest as unclear communication channels, unresponsiveness, or delayed responses. The collected data highlights the frustration and annoyance that the majority of clients encounter when attempting to communicate with wedding organizers via the internet. It emphasizes how crucial it is to upgrade the online platforms' methods of communication in order to improve the whole experience for customers who are seeking wedding-related services.
