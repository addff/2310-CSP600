## TITLE : LAUNDRY PICKUP MOBILE APPLICATION

### 1.0 Background of Study
Laundry management systems are becoming increasingly popular in campus settings,
as they offer a number of benefits to students. With a traditional system, students often
have to stand in long lines to drop off and pick up their laundry (Ahmad Lawal, et
al.,2022). This can be a time-consuming and frustrating process for everyone involved.
A laundry management system can help to eliminate this problem by notifying students
the cycle progress on how much time is left for their laundry to be completed. With such
system, customers do not need to wait and do other things while their laundry is in the
process.

One of the main challenges is that customers need to wait for their laundry to finish,
which can be inconvenient if they have other commitments. If customers delay in
removing their laundry, it can also inconvenience other customers who need to use the
machines. This problem is particularly acute in campus settings, as students often have
busy schedules and need to get their laundry done quickly and efficiently. A laundry
management system can be used to address the problem of poor time management in
self-service laundries by allowing customers to book machines in advance and receive
notifications when their laundry is finished (Muhammad Umair Khan, et al.,2022).

The app uses real-time data streaming to view the availability of washers and dryers in
real time, push notifications to notify users when their laundry is finished. It also allow
users to create a laundry schedule and order tracking for users to track the status of
their laundry. The app was developed using Java for the backend and Kotlin for the
Android.

Therefore, this project can help to reduce waiting time and improve the overall laundry
experience for everyone involved.


### 2.0 Problem Statement
Lack of awareness of machine availability and lack of control over laundry time

A recent study by Khan et al. (2022) found that customers of coin-operated laundromats
spend an average of 30 minutes waiting for machines to become available. Coinoperated laundromats often have a limited number of machines and these machines
can be in high demand, especially during peak hours. This can lead to long waiting
times for customers, especially if they are not able to plan their laundry time in advance.
Customers of self-service laundromats are often busy students or professionals who
have limited time to do their laundry. Therefore, waiting for machines to become
available and inefficient use of laundry time can be a significant inconvenience for these
customers. Poor time management in self-service laundromats can also lead to
overcrowding and frustration. When customers have to wait for machines to become
available, they are more likely to crowd around the machines, making it difficult for other
customers to move around.

Customers may lose their belongings or their laundry may be damaged if they
leave them unattended while their laundry is running

Regarding security concerns, the article states that "Customers expressed concern
about the safety of their belongings and laundry when they are left unattended at the
laundromat. " (Al-Mutairi, 2019). First, coin-operated laundromats are often in public
places, where they are accessible to anyone. This means that there is a risk that
belongings could be stolen or laundry could be vandalized. Second, coin-operated
laundromats are often crowded and noisy. This can make it difficult to keep an eye on
belongings or laundry, especially if customers are multitasking. A mobile app that allows
customers to view the availability of machines in real time and receive notifications
when their laundry is finished could address all of these problems. This would allow
customers to plan their laundry time and avoid having to wait for machines to become
available. It would also allow customers to leave their laundry unattended without
having to worry about it being lost or damaged


### 3.0 Objectives
1. To identify the challenges faced by customers of coin-operated laundromats in
campus Jasin.
2. To develop a mobile app that allows customers of coin-operated laundromats to
view the availability of machines in real time.
3. To design a user interface for the mobile app that is easy to use and convenient.


### Scope
The target user for this project is for the customers of coin-operated laundromats in
Campus Jasin. The mobile app will be developed for Android devices and using Flutter
for the cross-platform mobile development. This will save time and resources, as
developers will only need to write the code once for both platforms. Next, Firebase for
the backend development as Firebase is a cloud-based platform that provides a variety
of services for mobile app development including authentication, database, storage, and
hosting. This will allow developers to focus on building the core features of the app
without having to worry about the backend infrastructure. The mobile app will be
developed in English and Malay. This will make the app accessible to customers in
UiTM Campus Jasin who speak either language. The mobile app will allow customers to
view the availability of machines in real time and receive notifications when their laundry
is finished.


### 4.0 Significance 
Waiting time in coin-operated laundromats can be a significant inconvenience for
customers. It can also be a barrier to access for customers who are short on time or
who have other commitments. A mobile app that allows customers to view the
availability of machines in real time can help to reduce waiting time and make coinoperated laundromats more convenient and accessible for customers (Khan, M. U.,
Khan, S. U., & Khan, A. U. ,2022).

The proposed study is important to both customers of coin-operated laundromats and
the owners and operators of coin-operated laundromats. For customers, the study can
help to identify ways to reduce waiting time and improve the overall laundry experience.
For owners and operators of coin-operated laundromats, the study can provide insights
into the needs of their customers and how they can improve their services.

The laundry management has the potential to make a significant contribution to society
by improving the laundry experience for customers of coin-operated laundromats. It can
also help to inform the development of new policies and programs to support the coinoperated laundromat industry.

The proposed study can determine the most effective ways to reduce waiting time in
coin-operated laundromats using a mobile app such as can quantify the reduction in
waiting time achieved by using a mobile app to look up the availability of machines in
use. The proposed project can help to preserve the coin-operated laundromat industry
by making it more convenient and accessible for customers. The proposed study can
help customers of coin-operated laundromats to give feedbacks about the machines.


### 5.0 Summary
This project will justify the usage of laundry mobile app in helping customers more on
scheduling their laundry. The usage of laundry management system is an effective way
in helping customers to create enjoyment in doing laundry. Customers of coin-operated
laundromats often face long waiting times, as they have to wait in line to check the
availability of machines and wait for machines to become available. This can be timeconsuming, frustrating, and inconvenient. A mobile app that allows customers to view
the availability of machines in real time and provide feedbacks could address these
problems and improve the customer experience. Additionally, customers of coin-
operated laundromats express concern about the safety of their belongings and laundry
when they are left unattended at the laundromat. Laundromat owners can implement
measures to address these concerns, such as providing more machines, offering online
booking, and installing security cameras. Overall, the development of a mobile app to
reduce waiting time in coin-operated laundromats has the potential to significantly
improve the customer experience and make coin-operated laundromats more
convenient and accessible for customers.
