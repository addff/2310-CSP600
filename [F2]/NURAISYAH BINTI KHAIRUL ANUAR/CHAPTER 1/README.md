## TITLE : LAUNDRY PICKUP MOBILE APPLICATION

### Issue

1. Lack of awareness of machine availability 
2. Lack of control over laundry time

### Evidence

Basic facts either observation, questionnaire, interview, or article

1.	Customers of coin-operated laundromats typically wait an average of 30 minutes for machines to become available (Khan et al.,2022). According to a survey, 45% of people usually take 3 hours to do their laundry at laundromat. This is a major concern because it can be a barrier to access for people who have other commitments.

2. Laundromat customers expressed worries about the security of their belongings and laundry while they were away from the machines (Al-Mutairi, 2019). Based on the survey conducted, 45% of the 40 respondents concerns about their personal safety. This is a significant percentage, and it suggests that laundromat owners and managers need to take steps to address these concerns. In addition to implementing physical security measures, developing a mobile app can also contribute to a more secure laundromat environment.

•	65% of people are frustrated by losing track of their laundry. A mobile app could help by sending them notifications when their laundry is finished or needs to be moved to the dryer.

•	42.5% of people are frustrated by dealing with other people at the laundromat. A mobile app could help by letting customers book machines and get notifications remotely, so they don't have to interact with others as much.
