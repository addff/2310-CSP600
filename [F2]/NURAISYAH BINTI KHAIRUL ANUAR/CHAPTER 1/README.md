## TITLE : LAUNDRY PICKUP MOBILE APPLICATION

### Issue

1. Lack of awareness of machine availability 
2. Lack of control over laundry time

### Evidence

A recent study by Khan et al. (2022) found that customers of coin-operated laundromats
spend an average of 30 minutes waiting for machines to become available. Coinoperated laundromats often have a limited number of machines and these machines
can be in high demand, especially during peak hours. When customers have to wait for machines to become
available, they are more likely to crowd around the machines, making it difficult for other
customers to move around.

Regarding security concerns, the article states that "Customers expressed concern
about the safety of their belongings and laundry when they are left unattended at the
laundromat. " (Al-Mutairi, 2019). First, coin-operated laundromats are often in public
places, where they are accessible to anyone. This means that there is a risk that
belongings could be stolen or laundry could be vandalized.

### Problem Identification

The need for a comprehensive digital solution to address students laundry time management and the safety of their belongings.

### Solution
1. The app uses real-time data streaming to view the availability of washers and dryers in
real time
2. Notify users when their laundry is finished.
3. Allow users to create a laundry schedule and order tracking for users to track the status of their laundry.
