### Evidence
Basic fact either observation, questionaire, interview, article

1. According to (Anje International Quranic Preschool,2023), obtaining the necessary information by manual administration may take a while, particularly if the data is physically dispersed over several files. This may impair the ability to make timely decisions.
2. Difficulties to communicate between all participant in educational process is the one of the problem of educational inclusive instituion in system of network interaction. (Kassymova et al., 2018)
3. Ibrahim and Mohamed (2019) cite the fact that the majority of kindergartens still manage their data and information manually. Every piece of data or information is frequently recorded on paper and stored in a file. This approach has caused the management a great deal of issues, particularly when all the information is needed quickly.

### Problem Identification

2. Parents and teacher can have real-time communication through the app
3. All the kindergarten data information will sync properly and secure in this app
4. Develop an attendance tracker system with features allowing parents to inform teachers through the PreschoolPulse application if their children will not be attending preschool
