# CHAPTER 1
## PROJECT STATEMENT

### ISSUE
	• Traditional penetration testing tools are often time-consuming and expensive to use.
	• They can be complex to configure and use, requiring skilled personnel.
	• They may not be able to identify all vulnerabilities, especially new or emerging ones.
	• Organizations are increasingly moving to cloud-based infrastructures, which present new security challenges.

### EVIDENCE
	1. 86% of organizations have experienced a data breach in the past 12 years.
		○ This statistic shows that data breaches are very common, and that no organization is immune. It also highlights the importance of having a robust security posture in place
	2. The average cost of a data breach in 2022 was $4.35 million.
		○ This statistic highlights the significant financial impact that data breaches can have on organizations. It is also a reminder that the cost of data breaches is increasing over time.
	3. 92% of oraganizations believe that their cloud insfrastructure is at risk of attack.
		○ This statistic shows that organizations are aware of the security risks associated with cloud computing. It also highlights the need for effective security measures to be implemented to protect cloud-based systems.
	4. The use of AI in penetration testing is still in its early stages , but it has the potential to revolutionize the industry.
		○ AI has the potential to make penetration testing more efficient, effective, and scalable. AI-powered tools can automate tasks, identify vulnerabilities more accurately, and reduce the cost and complexity of testing.
	
### PROBLEM INDENTIFICATION
The efficiency and scalability of traditional penetration testing techniques are inadequate to satisfy the demands of contemporary enterprises. They frequently cost a lot of money and take a long time, needing sophisticated equipment and trained workers. Furthermore, not all vulnerabilities—especially ones that are recent or emerging—may be found using conventional penetration testing methods.
	• Time-consuming and expensive: 
       - Traditional penetration testing can be a very time-consuming and expensive process. This is because it requires skilled personnel to manually configure and use the tools, and to analyze the results of the tests.
	• Complex tools: 
       - Traditional penetration testing tools can be very complex to use, requiring specialized knowledge and skills. This can make it difficult for organizations to find and retain the qualified personnel needed to conduct penetration testing effectively.
	• Limited vulnerability coverage: 
       - Traditional penetration testing tools may not be able to identify all vulnerabilities, especially new or emerging ones. This is because they are often based on known vulnerabilities and attack techniques.


### SOLUTION
	• Use AI-powered cloud-based penetration testing tools.
		  ○  AI-powered penetration testing tools can automate tasks, identify vulnerabilities more accurately, and reduce the cost and complexity of testing. Examples of AI-powered cloud-based penetration testing tools include:
    			§ Vulnerability scanners: 
    				  □ AI-powered vulnerability scanners can automatically scan for vulnerabilities in cloud-based systems.
    			§ Attack simulators: 
    				  □ AI-powered attack simulators can simulate real-world attacks on cloud-based systems to help organizations identify and mitigate security risks.
    			§ Security posture assessment tools: 
    				  □ AI-powered security posture assessment tools can assess the security posture of cloud-based systems and identify areas for improvement.
	• Implement a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform.
		  ○  A SOAR platform can automate security tasks, such as incident response and threat remediation.
	• Use a cloud security information and event management (SIEM) solution.
		  ○  A SIEM solution can collect and analyze security logs from cloud-based systems to identify security threats
