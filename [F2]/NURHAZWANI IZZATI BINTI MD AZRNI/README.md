# Chapter 1 Introduction

## Project Statement

### Issue
Many tuition centers currently employ a manual tuition management system. This technique involves enrolling subjects at the administrator counter, marking attendance without notifying parents, and handling payments at the same counter.  

### Evidence
Basic facts either observation, questionnaire, interview, or article

  1. A look at the current fee management systems shows that they have problems with being inefficient, which means that teachers often          have trouble keeping accurate records of student attendance (Kamaroszaman,2022).
  2. Administrative functions related to tuition administration and education       
     arerarely automated (Mustapha,2022).
  3. Educational institutions lack transparency and accountability in tuition charge administration. This issue is especially important as       educational institutions move from cash-based payments to internet purchases, which are convenient but present challenges(Rahimi,2022).

### Problem Identification
Describe briefly the problem matter

 1. Manual Learning Process: The current tuition management system relies on manual tasks, causing inconvenience for parents who have to visit in person, hindering communication. Students face difficulties enrolling in subjects, taking exams in hard copy, and accessing teaching materials. Teachers deal with paperwork, and attendance records can be unreliable. Educational administrators face resource-intensive processes and payment issues.

2. Poor Tuition Fee Transparency: Tuition fee management lacks transparency due to manual, cash-based payments, making it hard to track finances accurately. This can lead to errors and affect trust in the system. It's crucial to address this issue and enhance fee management transparency.

### Solution
your final product and importance

  1. Develop or implement a digital tuition management system that enables online topic enrollment, attendance notification, and payment processing.
  2. Develop an online portal or app through which students and parents can enroll in classes remotely. In-person enrollment at the administrator's counter is no longer required.
  3. Develop an online payment gateway to allow for simple and safe payments. Credit cards, online banking, and digital wallets are examples of payment methods. Payments can be made using the device of the student or parent's choice.
