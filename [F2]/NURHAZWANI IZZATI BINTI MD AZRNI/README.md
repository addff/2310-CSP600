# Chapter 1 Introduction

## Project Statement

### Issue
Many tuition centers currently employ a manual tuition management system. This technique involves enrolling subjects at the administrator counter, marking attendance without notifying parents, and handling payments at the same counter.  

### Evidence
Basic facts either observation, questionnaire, interview, or article

  1.  The current system for the management of tuition in the field of education faces a number of difficulties that affect a wide range of user communities (Kamaroszaman,2022).
  2. The educational process becomes inefficient when exams and quizzes are still administered in hard copy (Mustapha,2022).
  3. Educational institutions lack transparency and accountability in tuition charge administration. This issue is especially important as       educational institutions move from cash-based payments to internet purchases, which are convenient but present challenges(Rahimi,2022).

### Problem Identification
Describe briefly the problem matter

 1. Manual Learning Process: The current tuition management system relies on manual tasks, causing inconvenience for parents who have to visit in person, hindering communication. Students face difficulties enrolling in subjects, taking exams in hard copy, and accessing teaching materials. Teachers deal with paperwork, and attendance records can be unreliable. Educational administrators face resource-intensive processes and payment issues.

2. Poor Tuition Fee Transparency: Tuition fee management lacks transparency due to manual, cash-based payments, making it hard to track finances accurately. This can lead to errors and affect trust in the system. It's crucial to address this issue and enhance fee management transparency.

### Solution
your final product and importance

  1. To develop an Enhanced Tuition Management system using Progressive Web App (PWA) technology and a Payment Gateway API to automate and streamline administrative operations in educational institutions
2. To test the effectiveness of the Enhanced Tuition Management system in addressing problems, including attendance monitoring, subject registration, assessment management, and tuition payment handling
