## ISSUE
- Nowadays, tourism is one of the economic contributors for a country. Tourists sometimes will prefer to use a travel application to make sure their trip went well especially for a first time traveler. This is because travel apps facilitate users in researching destinations, discovering affordable flight and accommodation options, and booking various services, thus enabling a seamless experience. But somehow they find out that it's difficult to get access as the application need strong internet connectivity to function well. However not all the area will provide strong internet connection such as rural area.
## BASIC FACTS
-Not all the places user’s can get access to the internet such as rural areas. Rural areas have always struggled to match the broadband opportunities of urban ones (Irune Ruiz-Martínez & Javier Esparcia Pérez, 2020)
- From the macroeconomic viewpoint and going beyond only the simulation of arrivals, climate change  will not affect the total level of tourist expenditures but will affect destinations where they spend their money (Scaglione & Marut, 2011).
- Based on current travel application analysis, only one out of 16 application provide offline maps
- Based on current travel application analysis, only two out of 16 application provide weather forecasting 
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Some area don't have internet connection
- Weather information not being updated in real-time
## SOLUTIONS
- Create mobile application that provide offline maps and navigation
- Create mobile application that provide real-time weather forecasting
