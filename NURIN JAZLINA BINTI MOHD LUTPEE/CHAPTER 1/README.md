## TITLE; Tranquil Mind: Mental Health Mobile Application using Geolocation

### Project Background
- Developing mobile applications for mental health patients diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
- Mental Health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It includes their ability to control emotions, think logically, maintain healthy social relationships, and cope with life's problems.
- Mobile apps are alternatives that help increase engagement, facilitate therapy, and retain gains when treatment is over to provide mental health services that are more inexpensive and accessible (Noronha,2022).

### Problem Statement
- The patient forgets appointments and neglects to take medication as recommended(Saboo, 2021).
- Mental health problems become challenging when individuals refuse to receive treatment (Saboo, 2021).
- Necessitate costly and time-consuming procedures (Yang, 2021).

### Objective
- To develop a mobile application that can assist patients who were diagnosed with mental health conditions by enabling them to schedule appointments through the application and access self-help resources.
- To evaluate the app's design for user-friendliness, ease of navigation, and accessibility.
- To provide cost-effective mental health services and support, particularly to those who might otherwise not have access to  mental health care.
