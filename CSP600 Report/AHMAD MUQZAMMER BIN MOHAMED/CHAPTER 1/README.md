# CHAPTER 1

## INTRODUCTION

This chapter describe the introduction of the proposal titled “Roadguard Roadside Emergency Assistance”. This chapter discusses several subtopics which are project background, problem statement, project objectives, project scopes and project significance.

## 1.1	Background of Study

Vehicles are surely one of the most important things in our daily lives. They operate as essential things for movement and convenience, allowing us to move from one location to another by allowing people to complete their normal jobs and activities. The development of vehicles has given us the opportunity to complete our daily lives by giving us flexibility, whether we are carrying groceries, driving to work, or on holiday.
Vehicles are important for more than just getting around. They're very important to making our lives better in general. Vehicles make getting to our destinations faster and easier, giving us more time to spend with family and friends, explore personal hobbies, or do fun things. Having a wide range of vehicles, such as scooters, cars, trucks, and public transport, means that there is a way to get around for everyone. This promotes inclusion and lets people from all walks of life take part in social and economic activities.
The goal is to make an app called RoadGuard that is an innovative solution designed to tackle the challenges and complexities surrounding roadside assistance services. It emerges as a response to the critical and recurring issues that motorists face when their vehicles experience unexpected breakdowns or emergencies while on the road. The services this app offers are to provide services on the spot if the vehicle is repairable at the place, so people can continue to go to their destination. This project's core objective is to develop a highly user-centric mobile application that establishes a seamless connection between motorists in distress and certified service providers. This connection is built upon the foundations of safety, reliability, and convenience in the landscape of roadside assistance.

## 1.2	Problem Statement 
## 1.2.1	Inefficient Location-Based Service
There are many road situations in Malaysia that do not ensure the safety of the driver. People driving cars or someone riding a bike may encounter unpredictable situations when they hit a sharp object on the road that makes their tire punctured. Vehicle breakdowns are unexpected events in which a vehicle fails while driving on the road and has to stop (Chand et al., 2020).

There is situation, when drivers experience a car breakdown in an unfamiliar area, it can be tough. They might not know the local roads safe spot to stop. Without the implement of location service, it might be hard to communicate to the workshop to pinpoint their location. Finding mechanics nearest can be challenging regardless of where you travel. (A. Surekha et al., 2022)

## 1.2.2	Lack of Trust in Service Quality

As sensible car owners know, having the number of a reliable mechanic on hand is very important. Unexpected things can happen on the road at any time, like engine problems, breaks, or flat tires. Being ready can make all the difference. To ensure the safety of drivers and passengers, a trustworthy mechanic can give expert advice, quick help, and effective solutions. Also, having a reliable technician on hand can cut down on the time and stress that come with these situations, letting drivers get back on the road with confidence. You might feel more at ease knowing that you can rely on a trustworthy roadside help service, particularly when you're traveling far distances or to a new place (Arpits, 2023).

While it's helpful to have the contact information of a reliable mechanic on hand when you're in town, it can be a problem when you're moving. This limitation in terms of reliability can make things more difficult, which is why it's important to know the rating and feedback from previous people who have already received the services before you contact the workshop. It is common for businesses to take advantage of customers in the name of service. The issue is replacing original parts with old ones. (Gomathy,2022).

The solution to this problem is by developing an app called RoadGuard that uses geolocation to overcome it. RoadGuard can pinpoint where the breakdown car is located and provide trustworthy mechanics that have registered in the application to ensure the reliability of the car owner. It also provides transparent pricing information and even the option for users to rate and review the quality of the services they receive.

## 1.3	Project objective

I.	To design and develop an intuitive and user-friendly mobile application that allows users to request emergency roadside assistance quickly and easily.

II.	To evaluate the application user friendly, geolocation accuracy and the ease of use. 

## 1.4	Project scope

## 1.4.1	Target User

The targeted users who should use the Roadguard app are vehicle owners, especially those who go on long trips or drive in places where there aren't many choices for roadside assistance. The app is designed to work well for both new and experienced drivers, with a simple, easy-to-understand screen that everybody can use. 

## 1.4.3	Location
The location for the roadguard application will be Jasin, Melaka, due to its lack of public transportation. Most people who live in Jasin must have their own transportation. Through Jasin, the application can be introduced and its usefulness tested. The area's diverse population and number of driving situations make it a great place to test the app's ability to meet the needs of many users.


## 1.4.2	Functionality
The Roadguard app uses real-time data to give users the most up-to-date information on mechanics and workshops that are open. Users can easily find the service providers that are closest to them based on where they are, which helps them get where they need to go quickly and easily. The app also lets users narrow down their search results by specific factors, like the type of repair needed and the rate of the mechanic. 

For road assistance side, roadguard provides with real-time location data, which allows them to dispatch the nearest available mechanic to the scene of a breakdown. This can significantly reduce response times and help to get vehicle owners back on the road as quickly as possible.
