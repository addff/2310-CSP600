## Project Background

Attendance is a must for students. Without attendance process, the lecturer cannot
access the participation of a student in the class. Even in 21st century, attendance system
still done manually (Wiriasto, Surya Aji & Budiman, 2020). This will cause problem not
only use of excess paper but also difficulty for the administration to recapitulate student
attendance results (Hidayat & Simalango, 2018) . UiTM itself have their own attendance
platform, called Ufuture. From observation, the attendance system can helps lecturer in
calculating the likelihood that students will take exams and one of the uses of this
attendance information to those who are teaching and learning activities, among others,
to evaluate students' satisfaction with a subject and create benchmarks for the future
(Hidayat & Simalango, 2018, ) . The existing attendance platform, Ufuture have many
problems such as not convenience since it only in a website form. So, creating a new
one-defined mobile application for students to tick their attendance and give real-time
notifications and alerts that will appear on the user's smartphone, to notify the students
to tick their attendance (Hidayat & Simalango, 2018).

System information management in attendance system is to ensure the efficient of
upload data such as Medical Certificates and monitoring of the attendance by the
students itself . Besides, it is also to view user profile, attendance records and integration
with other platforms such as example Mobile App and Website. Website that are made
still have some shortcomings, therefore several things can be developed so that the
application runs better in its use. An applications can be given features to handle
conditional student days by adding features to upload their Medical Certificates
(Wiriasto et al., 2020).
Mobile Application have become instrumental in streaming various administrative
processes. The usage of mobile application especially for attendance tracking not fairly
being used worldwide. There is various kind of mobile apps that widely used such as
WhatsApp, Telegram and Instagram. Mobile application mostly need to be installed on
the smart devices such as smart phones and tablets. In this era, smart phones is
compulsory for everyone since everything in this world is surround with technology
such as pay using e-wallet and even we can watch movies through smart phones differ
than back in era where technology not being well-known.

Real-time notifications and alerts in attendance system is to ensure students to be
more alert about their attendance performance. This is because, by this real-time
notifications students will get notifies to tick their attendance. Absences are quickly
identified , resulting in the student and staff taking suitable action quickly and in the best
interest (Patil & Shinde, 2020). There also real-time alerts to give alerts to students if
they already absence more than 10%. This way is to prevent students from getting
warning letter from the university since the absence rate can’t be more than 20%
especially UiTM right now getting more serious about students presence in classes.

## Problem Statement
1. No real-time notification to remind attendance
2. Lack of monitoring features to monitor absent
   
## Objective
1. To design and develop SimpleSign : SimpleSign : Real-Time Monitoring UiTM’s
Students Attendance using Mobile Application and Website for students and lecturers
in UiTM.
2. To evaluate the effectiveness of SimpleSign : Real-Time Monitoring UiTM’s Students
Attendance using Mobile Application and Website using User Acceptance Testing.

## Project Scope
### Location
The SimpleSign : Real-Time Notification and Monitoring UiTM’s Students Attendance
will be used in UiTM which has in total 35 branches. The university approximately had
160,957 students in 2017 . With a big amount of students, this will give hard times to
lecturers to generate students’ attendance annual reports. SimpleSign : UiTM’s Students
Attendance System will be most helpful when it comes to generating reports.

### Users
SimpleSign : Real-Time Notification and Monitoring UiTM’s Students Attendance using
Mobile Application and Website will benefit students and lecturers in UiTM. Students
can tick their attendance, and send Medical Certificates in one-defined platform. While
lecturers can view and validate students’ attendance.

### Technology
SimpleSign : Real-Time Notification and Monitoring UiTM’s Students Attendance is
using Mobile Application and Website. Mobile application for students to get
notifications to tick attendance and to get alerts if they already absent more than 10%.
Website for students to view their attendance performance and view lecturers details.

### Mode
SimpleSign : Real-Time Notification and Monitoring UiTM’s Students Attendance using
Mobile Application and Website is online .

### Functionality
The main feature of SimpleSign : Real-Time Notification and Monitoring UiTM’s
Students Attendance using Mobile Application and Website. This system will help
students to monitor their attendance performance through a website. By using the 
website, students also can view their lecturers’ details such as name, number phone ,
e-mail and the lecturer’s room number. This can help students to save time to find it
manually since not some lecturers’ so busy to meet them face-to-face. This system also
coming with a mobile application that help students to tick their attendance in
one-defined application so they don’t have any confusing issue. The mobile app itself
will remind students by sending notifications to tick their attendance for upcoming
classes. It also will send alerts to students if their absence rate already passed 10% so
that students will take action and more concern about their attendance performance.
Students also can send their Medical Certificates or any documents related their absence
in class through this applications.

## Project Significant
1. Real-time notification to remind attendance
2.  Monitoring attendance performance by students

## Summary
SimpleSign : Real-Time Monitoring UiTM’s Students Attendance using Mobile 
Application and Websites aims to enchance the precision and effectiveness of UiTM in 
taking and monitoring students’ attendance.
