# 1.1   Background of Study

Road transportation is a vital component of modern society, enabling the movement of goods and people. However there are challenges, and accidents, vehicle breakdowns, and other unforeseen incidents are all too common occurrences. The rapidly increasing number of vehicles lead to a higher risk exposure to road accidents despite the upgrading of the infrastructure, the construction of new roads and highways (Eusofe & Evdorides, 2017). Traditional roadside assistance systems have long been in place to address these issues, but they often rely on outdated processes and communication methods, leading to delayed responses and a lack of efficiency in assisting those in distress. Most of traffic jams were caused by incident or car breakdown on the roadside because of inefficiency of the assist on the road. This system can be improvise by leverage real-time data exchange and digital connectivity, offers the opportunity to revolutionize how roadside assistance is provided and focusing on the need for modernization in addressing road incidents. Other than that the risk of getting scam by untrusted towing service that take advantages of people that having problems on the road.

As technological advancements continue to shape the world, the demand for more efficient and responsive roadside assistance systems has become increasingly apparent. Traditional systems often suffer from challenges related to communication delays and inaccuracies in incident location identification. The accident guard system aims to address these issues by integrating real-time data sharing, location-based services, and streamlined communication to provide rapid and effective assistance to stranded motorists. By using netcentric elements this system seeks to optimize the response to road incidents, enhancing the safety and convenience of road users.

To address these challenges and improve the quality of road services, an application that can overcome these problem could be accomplish to overcome problems that occur on the road.

# 1.2      Problem Statement

# 1.2.1   Communication Gaps in Incident Coordination

The current roadside assistance systems often suffer from inefficiencies, leading to delayed response times in providing assistance to road users involved in accidents or experiencing vehicle breakdowns. These inefficiencies are exacerbated by the lack of real-time communication and location accuracy. As a result, road users are left in distress for extended periods, risking safety and experiencing increased inconvenience.

# 1.2.2    Safety Risk and User Discontent

Road incidents require effective coordination among various stakeholders, including distressed road users, towing services, and emergency responders. However, the existing systems lack seamless communication channels, resulting in miscommunications and suboptimal response coordination. This deficiency can lead to confusion, delays, and subpar incident management.

# 1.2.3    Inefficient Response to Road Incidents

The suboptimal response times and communication challenges of current roadside assistance systems pose safety risks to road users and contribute to user discontent. The potential consequences of these issues include traffic congestion, secondary accidents, and emotional distress among those awaiting assistance. Addressing these problems is essential not only for improving user satisfaction but also for enhancing overall road safety and the efficiency of transportation networks.

# 1.3     Objective

a)	To develop Accident Guard: Road Incident Management application by using netcentric element such as geolocation and web scrapping.
b)	The objective of using geolocation is to accurately determine and utilize the geographic location data to enhance the functionality and efficiency of systems, applications, or services, facilitating services such as location-based marketing, navigation, asset tracking, and improved user experiences.

# 1.4     Project Scope

# 1.4.1  Location

My main target for this application is within the road in Malaysia, this project scope revolves around the design and development of an advanced roadside assistance application. The primary goal is to elevate the overall roadside assistance experience for the end-users, the road users of Malaysia. This user-centric project is driven by the intention to significantly enhance response times, efficiency, and the safety of road users, ensuring their satisfaction and peace of mind.

# 1.4.2  Stakeholder	

Key stakeholders involved in the project include not only the end-users but also the essential contributors to the roadside assistance ecosystem in Malaysia. These stakeholders encompass towing services, whose role is to provide timely support, and workshops, which play a crucial part in vehicle repair and maintenance. By uniting these stakeholders within the scope, the project intends to create a comprehensive and interconnected solution that streamlines incident response, minimizes inconveniences, and ultimately advances the safety and convenience of Malaysia's road users.



# 1.4.3  Functionality

a)	Incident Reporting: Users should be able to quickly report accidents or vehicle breakdowns through the app, providing essential details such as the incident's location and nature.

b)	Real-Time Location Tracking: Implement GPS and geolocation services to accurately pinpoint the user's location, aiding in faster response times.

c)	Towing Service Directory: Provide a directory of nearby towing services, including their contact information and user ratings.

d)	Communication Tools: Enable real-time communication between the user, towing service providers, and emergency responders, facilitating clear and efficient coordination.

e)	Service Request Tracking: Allow users to track the status of their service request, including the estimated time of arrival for assistance.

f)	Safety Features: Include safety tips, guidelines, and emergency contact information for users to access during incidents


# 1.5     Significant

# 1.5.1  Enhanced Safety

By reducing response times and improving coordination during road incidents and breakdowns, the project significantly contributes to the safety of road users. Timely assistance and streamlined communication can reduce the risk of accidents, secondary incidents, and potential harm to those in distress. It also can help user from unknown party involves because of web scrapping method it can determine which trusted and untrusted workshop.  

# 1.5.2   User Satisfaction and Reduced Inconvenience

The project's focus on user-centric improvements addresses the issue of user discontent resulting from delayed assistance. By providing faster, more reliable support and streamlined communication, road users will experience reduced distress and inconvenience during road incidents. This can achieve by using geolocation system that integrated in the app helps in improving the coordination. In return, enhances user satisfaction and overall well-being.

# 1.5.3  Reduce traffic

This application could also reduce traffic congestion during incidents or car breakdown has significant economic implications. It leads to cost savings by reducing the economic impact of prolonged road closures, secondary accidents, and traffic delays. This efficiency benefits both road users and the broader economy by minimizing the economic losses associated with road incidents.

# 1.6    Summary

The Accident Guard: Incident Management System is a service that offers rapid assistance to road users confronted with unexpected road incidents, including accidents and vehicle breakdowns. With its real-time communication capabilities and precise location tracking, the system ensures that help is just a click away, minimizing response times and enhancing overall safety on the road. By applying Netcentric elements, all the problems presented can be resolved. This user-centric solution not only streamlines incident management but also alleviates the anxiety and inconvenience often associated with road mishaps. By seamlessly connecting road users with towing services and emergency responders, the Roadside Towing System is a reliable and efficient lifeline, exemplifying the evolution of modern technology in enhancing road safety and the overall driving experience.
