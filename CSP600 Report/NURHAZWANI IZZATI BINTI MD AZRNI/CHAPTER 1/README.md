# CHAPTER 1

## INTRODUCTION 
This chapter provides the background and rationale for the study, addressing the challenges in current tuition management systems and the need for an Enhanced Tuition Management project to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and communication within educational institutions.

### 1.1 Background of study
Tuition system administration is critical in ensuring the efficient running of educational facilities in the realm of education (Kamaroszaman et al., 2022). The scope of responsibilities includes a wide range of tasks such as student attendance monitoring, course supervision, administration of quiz and test results, and tuition payment management. These tasks are more than just administrative in nature, as they have a direct impact on students' learning experiences as well as the overall operational success of educational institutions. Furthermore, the construction of clear and efficient communication channels between educators, students, and parents is a critical component for achieving educational system efficacy.

Nonetheless, current tuition management systems have severe flaws. They have major obstacles that limit their effectiveness. These challenges frequently manifest themselves as operational inefficiencies, errors, and breakdowns in communication within the educational ecosystem (Khalid, S. K. A., 2022). Educators face difficulties in successfully tracking student attendance, which can lead to disparities and inefficient use of time. The subject registration and administration procedure can be onerous, affecting both educators and learners who may find issues accessing the system. Inefficiencies in the handling of quiz and test results have the potential to disrupt the smooth operation of educational processes, creating unnecessary hurdles to educators. The procedure of tuition payments, which is critical in the field of education, may not be as efficient as intended, causing problems for educational institutions as well as parents.

Furthermore, the effectiveness and clarity of communication routes between teachers, students, and parents may be subpar. These factors can lead to misunderstandings, missed warnings, and a lack of transparency in the educational system.

The 'Enhanced Tuition Management' project aims to address the aforementioned pressing issues. The fundamental goal of this all-encompassing endeavour is to create a system that streamlines and improves the tuition management process. The goal of using this strategy is to increase the precision and efficacy of these critical administrative functions. Its goal, according to Rahimi et al., 2022, is to foster transparent and effective communication inside educational institutions, ensuring that all parties concerned are sufficiently informed and actively participating in the educational process.

It is critical to emphasise in the context of this study that we already have a stakeholder for the 'Enhanced Tuition Management' project. Pusat Tuisyen Balbir, an important member of the local education community, is our key stakeholder. Their active participation and interest in the project highlight its importance and relevance, as it addresses crucial challenges affecting educational institutions and the perspectives of educators, students, and parents.

The context of this study emphasises the importance of innovation in the field of education, with a particular emphasis on tuition management. The mentioned challenges are not minor in nature, as they have substantial ramifications for the day-to-day operations of educational institutions as well as the overall experiences of educators, learners, and caretakers. The 'Enhanced Tuition Management' project was created to solve the aforementioned issues, with the goal of optimising and improving these critical factors in the sphere of education. Throughout this inquiry, we will look at how technology, namely the introduction of Progressive Web App (PWA) technology and a Payment Gateway API, might help to bring about the desired transformation in tuition administration.


### 1.2 Problem Statement

This Section explained about the problem faced by Pusat Tuisyen Balbir

#### 1.2.1  Manual process in learning

According to research by Kamaroszaman et al. (2022), the current system for the management of tuition in the field of education faces a number of difficulties that affect a wide range of user communities. The difficulties described above are a direct result of the manual processes that are still being used.

From a parents point of view, enrolling their children in tuition subjects is not a simple task for parents. It requires a face-to-face visit to a counter, which is inconvenient and time-consuming. Moreover, there is no notification mechanism in place, so parents are not aware of important details regarding their child's presence at the tuition center. A strong bond between parents, teachers, and students is hampered by this lack of communication, which keeps parents in the dark and causes confusion (Khalid, S. K. A., 2022).

Next, from a student perspective, the existing tuition management system presents a number of challenges for students as well. It can be annoying to have to physically visit a counter in order to enroll in subjects because it is a laborious process. According to research by Rahimi et al.(2022), the educational process becomes inefficient when exams and quizzes are still administered in hard copy. Obtaining teacher-taken notes and videos is difficult since manual techniques are used. Since test and quiz results are given in hard copy, it might be challenging for students to keep track of their academic progress. Furthermore, since teachers physically record attendance in the absence of an automated system, students may be able to falsify their attendance records, which might be considered dishonest.

The present system's shortcomings also affect teachers personally. They have to deal with the laborious and ineffective procedure of supplying hardcopy exams, quizzes, notes, and videos. Their administrative burden is further increased by the hardcopy dissemination of exam and quiz results. Furthermore, there is no automated notification system to notify parents about attendance, thus teachers must manually maintain attendance records(P'ng Hooi Yin,2022). This may lead to possible errors in the attendance records of the students.

Educational administrators encounter a variety of difficulties with student enrollment in courses. The efficiency of the tuition management process is impacted by the resource-intensive and error-prone nature of manual processes. The issue is exacerbated by the fact that subject enrollment payment processes are not automated, underscoring the necessity of administrative job modernization and simplification. In summary, the manual procedures in the tuition management system are causing errors, operational inefficiencies, and communication breakdowns. As a result, a more user-friendly and efficient system needs to be developed to address these problems.


#### 1.2.2 Poor Tuition Fee Management Transparency 


The lack of transparency in the management of tuition fees, particularly in the payment process for subject enrollment, is one of the most significant problems that arise within the framework of the tuition management system. At the moment, stakeholder Pusat Tuisyen Balbir has mentioned that the majority of payments for participant enrollment are made in cash at the counter, and the associated receipts and payment methods are handled manually. This technique, which is both manual and cash-based, not only results in inefficiencies but also makes it difficult to maintain openness in regard to the financial aspects of tuition administration. It may create difficulties in precisely tracking payments and keeping a clear record of financial activities, both of which are vital for educational institutions as well as the parents or guardians of students. According to research by  Azizul  et al. (2022), this lack of transparency in the handling of tuition fees has the potential to result in errors and disparities, which will have an impact on both the general efficiency of the system and the trust that people have in it. As a consequence of this, there is an urgent requirement to solve this problem and improve the transparency of the management of tuition fees.

### 1.3 Objectives
#### a. To develop an Enhanced Tuition Management system using Progressive Web App (PWA) technology and a Payment Gateway API to automate and streamline administrative operations in educational institutions

#### b. To test the effectiveness of the Enhanced Tuition Management system in addressing problems, including attendance monitoring, subject registration, assessment management, and tuition payment handling




### 1.4 Project Scope

The project scope for the creation of Pusat Tuisyen Balbir's tuition management system includes several major aspects. To begin, the system will serve a varied collection of stakeholders, including parents or guardians of students attending the institution, students themselves, teaching staff, and the administrative team in charge of Pusat Tuisyen Balbir's daily operations. This inclusiveness guarantees that the system meets the needs and expectations of all parties involved.

In terms of technology, the system will make use of a variety of modern tools and frameworks to properly deliver its functions. It will be built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing for a consistent and responsive user experience across several devices and platforms. The system will interact with a Payment Gateway API to expedite tuition fee payments and improve security. In addition to the above technology stack and architecture, the system will provide real-time functionality with a particular focus on attendance management. These real-time features will allow for the automated transmission of student attendance information to parents or guardians. The system intends to improve openness and efficiency in attendance tracking by incorporating such features, guaranteeing that parents receive timely information regarding their child's presence in tuition classes. This feature not only simplifies attendance monitoring but also deepens the bond between parents and educational institutions.

The Laravel framework will be used to build the application, which is known for its strong and scalable capabilities in building web applications. PHP, a popular web development language, will be the primary programming language for the project. Sqlyog, a popular MySQL database administration tool, will be used as the interface to efficiently administer the database. MySQL, a stable and extensively used relational database management system, will be utilised to build the system's database. Finally, Laragon, a development environment and server stack that streamlines many web development activities, will help with database development and maintenance.

In summary, the scope of this project includes a diverse set of stakeholders, a technology stack, a framework, a programming language, and database components that will be used to create a comprehensive and efficient tuition management system tailored to the specific needs of Pusat Tuisyen Balbir.


### 1.5 Project Significance
The system considerably streamlines administrative processes, which is advantageous for tuition centers and teachers. It automated attendance monitoring, subject registration, assessment management, and tuition payment processing, resulting in time savings, error reduction, and enhanced productivity. This efficiency facilitates a more conducive environment for instruction and learning. 

The system positively impacts parents by emphasizing tuition fee transparency and accountability. It provides plain and thorough tuition fee breakdowns, enabling parents to make educated financial decisions regarding their children's education.
