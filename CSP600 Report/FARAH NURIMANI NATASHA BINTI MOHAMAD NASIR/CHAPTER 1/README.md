## Meteorun: A Fitness Mobile Application Using Geolocation with Personalized Plan And Route Recommendation Based on Users Preference. 
### 1.1 Project Background

Running has gained its popularity over the years as it became a popular choice for those who want to improve their physical fitness and mental health. The advantages that running offers to the physical are widely recognised in its proof (Oswald et al., 2020). Running which is a low-cost therapeutic exercise is possible for bettering psychological wellness as well as economically feasible (Oswald et al., 2020). Marathon is a type of running race that started in Athens thousands years ago. According to McCarthy (2021), the first marathon was held at the 1896 Olympics in Athens with just a total of 17 participants. Marathon running has gained its popularity over the years. This event is participated by both genders in a wide range of age groups globally. According to Emmanuel et al. (2017), an amount of 621.16 million people had joined in running globally. The population of participants in varieties of marathon types in Malaysia is also growing greatly as this sport has received more attention (Atlas, Nuraini Putit, Puem, & Enggong, 2018). For instance, after Covid-19 stops marathon events in Malaysia, over 10,000 athletes participated in IJM Land Half Marathon that makes a comeback after a three years hiatus (Half marathon returns, 2023).

Running plan or is a form of training plan is needed in order to prepare for a long distance running or marathon as it provides proper and relevant amount of training for runners. A running plan is a structured schedule which specifies the exercises and runs as well as increase the intensity of workouts, ensuring the body adapts, grows stronger, and prepares itself for the ultimate challenge of a marathon or to achieve a running or fitness goal. It is a part of training that acts as a daily or weekly schedule for runners to help them achieve their fitness or running goals, whether it is for a marathon or any other specific objective. Running plan schedules usually take around 12 to 20 weeks long to allow the body to have enough time to prepare for the length (Cleveland Clinic, 2023). Due to the length of running plans, it requires individuals to track their progress from time to time. Some people choose to journal and plan their training plan manually.

In today’s technological world, running-related applications have become useful instruments for running enthusiasts which include marathoners. As of June 2018, Google Play and the App Store have approximately 102.962 and 97.844, wellness and fitness applications respectively (Silva et al, 2020). This high number of wellness and fitness applications is because they provide the opportunity to connect with a significant number of users with little or no expense, are almost constantly available, and allow for real-time observation and responses, eventually serving for individually personalized approaches.

This project aims to develop a mobile application dedicated to running enthusiasts to fill the lacuna of most running applications especially in terms of providing a personalized and tailored running experience to runners. This mobile app provides functionality to cater to different individuals with different preferences by suggesting them running plans and running routes based on their goals, conditions, limitations and likings.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Based on the survey findings, three significant problem statements have emerged concerning wedding organizers.

1.2.1 Most online platforms do not offer enough personalization and flexibility in running plans provided.

Consistency is elusive for runners. Running might seems like an easy sport to implement in daily life, however the truth is most runners only have restricted time duration devoted to running and trainings. In this technology era, most runners rely on online platforms for recommendation and tips on running. Besides, most runners especially students could not afford to have a personal coach. People with packed schedule like students and office workers need to prioritize their works first before their hobby which has caused them to skip some days in set and strict running plans they made or obtained online due to the lack of spare time. This results in improper and insufficient amount of training. Besides, they also want to do other things during their spare time such as socializing with friends, joining events, and doing other hobby. Hence, a flexible regimen of running plan is more preferred than the strict one. According to the survey that were mostly participated by university students, 51.5% of them uses running application for recommendation on running plans but 21.3% are dissatisfied and 30.3% feels neutral about the running plans provided by the app. 

Runners face challenges to incorporate consistent running routine in their daily life is due to the lack of personalization and flexibility in running plans provided on online platforms. Most online platforms offer rigid and generic running plans. Hoppe (2020) stated that, runners who cannot afford to have custom made running plans need to be aware that running plans they obtained from other sources like on the Internet are produced to be used by everyone. A popular fitness app, Strava also lacks flexibility in its features of suggesting personalized running plans. According to Davie, the disadvantages of Strava’s running plan is that the default day of the beginning of the running plan is always Monday and it is unalterable according to his preference. He also said that he needs to strictly follows what plans the app provided and incorporate his schedule based on the running plan. (Medium, 2023). 

With Meteorun: A Fitness Mobile Application Using Geolocation with Personalize Content Recommendation Based on Users Preference. The prescribed running plans are based on user’s preferences where they answer a set of questions and rule-based technique is used to recommend running plans that is tailored to their preferences.

   
1.2.2 Lack of running application that recommends local running routes near runner’s area.

According to the survey, 81.2% of those who took the survey agreed that it is challenging to locate new running routes in their area and only 15.2 % rely on running applications for planning their running routes (figure 1.1). Based on the analysis, we could say that most runners stick with their usual running route without discovering new running routes and changing their running environment.

However, repetitiveness can quickly become monotonous and drain the excitement from running. According to Andy Dixon who is one of the readers, he lost his spark in running when he was preparing for more than half a year for his sub-three marathon because at that point the routine had become boring and unenjoyable (Runner’s World, 2017).  Besides, Many runners hesitate to explore new routes, either due to concerns about safety, a fear of the unknown, or a simple reluctance to break from the familiar. Shackleton, who is one of the readers of Runner’s World website stated that upon relocating to an unfamiliar neighborhood, she found herself lacking the self-assurance to venture out and explore new running routes, primarily because of her fear of losing her way during the process (Runner’s World, 2017).  The repetitive nature of running can become monotony, but it can be overcome by varying the running routes. Most runners plan their own running routes by themselves or by asking their friends and other local runners. This is shown by the result of the survey where a total of 72.2% which is a total of 24 people plan their route on their own without using any applications. While only 15.2% which is a total of only 5 people use running apps for suggestions on running routes, and the other 12.1% which is 4 people follow running routes that were established by local runners (figure 1.2). However, these methods provide inadequate adaptation to individual preferences as the recommendation suggested, subjective to their idea of “good” running routes.

This is because most running applications focus on analyzing runners' running metrics such as pace and heart rates. One of the most used running applications by runners which is Strava and Runtastic also focuses on analyzing user’s metrics but are not dedicated as route-planning apps. According to Runtastic (2023), they had also decided to bid farewell to their routes features. While there are some apps that allow users to track their own routes, the absence of built-in suggestions limits the experience, particularly for those seeking variety, new challenges, or simply convenience.

### 1.3 Objective
a) To design and develop Meteorun: A Fitness Mobile Application Using Geolocation with Personalize Plan And Route Recommendation Based on Users Preference. 

b) To evaluate the functionality and the effectiveness of the personalized running plan and routes recommendation mobile application that uses rule-based system and geolocation in enhancing user's experience.  
   
### 1.4 Scope

1.4.2	Location

This application area will be based in Melaka. It will provide running routes available around Melaka. However, the application’s functionality can be used anywhere. 

1.4.3 Technology

1.4.4.1	Geolocation
Allows the app to access the user's current location through the device's GPS. It is used for location-based services; Geolocation is used to find nearby running routes in user’s area.

1.4.4.2	APIs integration
APIs integration is used to retrieve relevant data from external services. For instance, integrating Google Maps API to display and navigate running routes. Other than that is integration with other fitness app like Runkeeper to import running plans 

1.4.4.3	Web Scraping
Web scraping is used to gather route data from websites or public databases. It is used to scrape running websites or databases to extract route details, including distance, terrain, elevation.

1.4.4.4	Database 
Database is essential for storing and managing various types of data for this app, such as user profiles, running routes, and user-generated content.

1.4.4	Technique

1.4.5.1	Rule-based system
Rule based system is used to set predefined rules to match user preferences for recommending personalized running plan and routes to users. For instance, the app will create predefined training plans with rules that consider a user's goals, fitness level, and running history to suggest personalized workout routines. Other than that, rule-based system is used to suggest running routes using rules to match according to user’s preferences (e.g., short and flat routes) with the characteristics of available routes in the database.

1.4.5	Functionality

1.4.5.1	User profile creation
Allow users to create profiles where they input personal information such as fitness level, goals, and location. User profile creation is typically implemented using forms and input fields in the app's user interface. Users can fill out the necessary details when signing up or in their account settings.

1.4.5.2	Survey and preferences
Implement a survey or questionnaire to collect detailed user preferences, including the number of days to run, target distances, and running terrain preferences.

1.4.5.3	Running plan generation
Generate personalized running plans based on user profiles and survey responses. Plans will consider factors like fitness level, goals, and available time for running.

1.4.5.4	Route recommendations
Recommend running routes based on the user's location, and preferences. 


### 1.5 Significance
1.5.1	Offers personalization and flexibility according to users’ preferences.

Each person has their unique strengths, weaknesses and targets that they wish to achieve. A running plan that may work for one person might not be suitable for another. This is because while one individual may aim to improve their speed, another might want to build endurance, and a third might be recovering from an injury. Thus, a one-size-fits-all running plan is often inadequate and can hinder an individual's progress. Besides, a strict and rigid running plans are less preferred as not everyone have the time to spare for running everyday. This makes consistency in training difficult for them. Therefore, a personalized running plans is essential in order to maximize every runners potential. Meteorun: A Fitness Mobile Application Using Geolocation with Personalize Content Recommendation Based on Users Preference provide, recommends running plans tailored to every user using rule-based system. Hence, the running plan is more flexible and can be implemented easily according to every individual’s daily life.

1.5.2 Provide running application that recommends local running routes near runner’s area.

Geolocation technology used in this application enables the app to provide location-specific recommendations, such as nearby scenic routes, and parks. This can help users explore new areas and discover hidden gems in their surroundings. It helps users to explore new areas and discover hidden gems that they may not have been aware of previously. This can help increase runners’ motivation and improve their mental health as the change of scenery contributes in stress reduction and enhanced mood. Paraskevopoulou et al. (2022), stated that their research supports the idea of establishing more pathway for runners outdoors, whether in parks where there is a lot of greenery, even better combined with the existence of the ocean, to boost running benefits such as lower heart rates and the production of positive feelings. Other than that, every runners preference on the type of pathway the run on differs based on their preferences. Besides, the route suggestion are catered to users’ preference to optimize the overall running experience and its benefits.
