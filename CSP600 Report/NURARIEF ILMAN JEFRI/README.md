INTRODUCTION 
 
 
1.1	Background of Study 

Food waste is a big problem that affects the environment, society, and economies worldwide. According to landfill operator SWCorp Malaysia, people in Malaysia generated 17,007 tonnes of food waste per day in 2021 and about 10 per cent of that is food that can still be eaten.

Especially in some areas where people don't have much, there's not enough good food to eat. To solve these problems, we came up with an idea called FoodSaver. It's like a special website that connects people who have extra food with those who need it. Food donors can easily list what they have, and people in need can claim it. It also uses maps to help find the closest places. This way, we can save food, reduce waste, and make sure no one goes to bed hungry.

FoodSaver goal is to stop food from going to waste and make sure everyone has enough to eat. It's like a friendly website where people share food and help each other. It uses maps and lets you tell others if the food was good. This makes sure it's safe and people can trust each other.

We believe FoodSaver can make a big difference by reducing food waste and helping those who do not have enough to eat. It is a simple and practical way to create a fairer and more eco-friendly food system.

1.2 	Problem Statement 
 
1.2.1 Food Waste and Its Environmental Impact in Malaysia
 
Food waste is a pervasive issue in Malaysia with extensive environmental repercussions. The discarded food generates greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change, and depletes vital resources in its production and distribution. This wastage is ecologically unsustainable within the Malaysian context and calls for immediate mitigation. More than 50% of Malaysian wasted food daily.
(phooi,azman,ismail,shah,koay,2022).Implementing sustainable practices and technologies in food production and distribution, promoting food waste reduction at the consumer level through awareness and education, and supporting food rescue and donation initiatives to ensure that surplus food is redirected to those in need.

1.2.2 Food Insecurity and Hunger in Malaysia
 
Concurrently, millions of individuals, including vulnerable populations in Malaysia, struggle with food insecurity and hunger In the 2022 Global Hunger Index, Malaysia scored moderately for hunger, with a small increase in the hunger index from 10.9 in 2014 to 12.5 in 2022. (Mahmood,Rajaram,Guinto,2022).The solution is to developing and supporting community-based initiatives to provide access to affordable and nutritious food, investing in local agriculture and food production, and creating efficient distribution channels to ensure that surplus food reaches individuals and communities facing food insecurity.
 
1.2.3 	Lack of Geolocation-Based Food Availability Information
 
The challenge is to find surplus food and share it efficiently with those in need, but we currently lack a simple system to do this in real-time, resulting in missed opportunities to prevent waste and reduce hunger. Many businesses and individuals have extra food to give, but there's no practical way to connect with them immediately. This leads to food waste and ongoing hunger issues. A solution is to create a geolocation-based platform where food donors easily list their surplus food, which can be instantly shared with those in need. 
 
1.3 	Objectives 
 
a)	To develop FoodSaver: Food Waste Reduction Desktop System using Geolocation. 
 
b)	To evaluate the usability of FoodSaver: Food Waste Reduction Platform using Geolocation.

1.4 	Project scope
 
1.4.1 Location
 
Melaka: The project's primary focus is on implementing FoodSaver within Melaka, with the potential for future expansion to other state based on the project's success.

1.4.2 Users
 
Food Donors: Individuals, restaurants, businesses, and organizations with surplus food.
Recipients: Individuals and organizations in need of food assistance.
Project Team: The development and management team responsible for creating, maintaining, and improving FoodSaver.

1.5 	Project Significance 

FoodSaver carries significant importance in addressing two major global challenges: food waste and food insecurity. By leveraging technology and community engagement, this project offers innovative solutions to make a positive impact on multiple fronts:

1.5.1 Environmental Sustainability
 
The project directly tackles food waste, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion. By reducing food waste through FoodSaver, we can play a part in mitigating climate change and conserving vital resources, such as water, land, and energy.

1.5.2 Food Security 

FoodSaver addresses the critical issue of food insecurity by efficiently connecting surplus food providers with individuals and organizations in need. This not only reduces hunger but also promotes a fair and reliable food distribution system.

1.5.3 Community Involvement 

The project fosters community engagement through its user-friendly platform, feedback mechanisms, and secure communication. This engagement creates a sense of responsibility and trust within the community and encourages active participation in food rescue and redistribution.

1.6 	Summary 

FoodSaver is a transformative project that addresses pressing global challenges with innovation and community engagement. By developing a user-friendly web application, we aim to connect surplus food providers with individuals and organizations in need, reducing food waste and alleviating hunger. The project's key features, geolocation-based matching, and feedback mechanisms enhance user experience and foster trust within the community. With a primary focus on Malaysia and future scalability, FoodSaver has the potential to make a substantial impact on food sustainability, environmental responsibility, and food security. Through ongoing monitoring, ethical considerations, and a commitment to sustainability, we aspire to create a better, more equitable food ecosystem for the benefit of all.
