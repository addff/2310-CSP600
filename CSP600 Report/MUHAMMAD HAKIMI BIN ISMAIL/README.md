# CHAPTER 1

## INTRODUCTION

This chapter describes the introduction of the proposal entitled “Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App using Geolocation”. This chapter discusses several subtopics which are project background, problem statements, project objectives, project scopes and project significance.

### 1.1 Background of Study

City is an area where large numbers of residents of all ages live together. City provides many job opportunities and many houses for people around the country. According to Lampard (2023), a city is defined by the centre of population which is larger in size and importance compared to town or village. It is also permanent and highly ordered. According to the Department of Statistic Malaysia (DOSM) (2020), based on the Population And Housing Census Of Malaysia of Malacca state, Malacca City has a population of 62175 citizens which is the highest in Malacca state. Having many citizens means the likelihood of criminal activities will increase, thus, make it riskier for citizens to live.

Location-based services use global position system (GPS) technology built-in inside the smartphones (Ahdan & Setiawansyah, 2021). The technology has been available commercially since 1989 with Magellan NAV 1000 as the first GPS receiver. Nowadays, most smartphones around the world have GPS chip in them. Geolocation services can be used to locate individual and track location history (Ochoa Gómez, 2022). Many applications have implemented their services with geolocation. Other than navigation applications, fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s also used geolocation in their application. One of the examples is when the customers want to locate nearby restaurants around them. Another service that uses GPS technology is geofencing. Geofencing is used for defining virtual boundaries or zones in real-world geographic areas. It can be used for location-based notifications to users’ smartphones (Tobin et al., 2023). For example, when the user enters a specific area such as a dangerous spot, the application will alert the user with a warning notification. 

Geotagging involves adding geographical metadata to different types of media such as images, videos and other digital. Nowak et al. (2021) said geographical coordinates are assigned to the subject. The precise location where the media was made or recorded is disclosed by this metadata. Digital cameras and smartphones with GPS or location-based services frequently employ geotagging to automatically add location information to the files. This can be proof that the media was made during a specific incident.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**1.2.1	Current safety applications lack tools to produce admissible media evidence for police cases.**

All safety applications should have features that make the media evidence admissible in court to get their rights. Safety applications should make emergency video recording as a feature. Admissible evidence is crucial when filing a report to authorities and required to establish the facts about the incident. It will support victims to make sure the victims are on the winning side. According to section 3 of Evidence Act 1950 (Act 56), any visual recording such as photos and videos can be used as evidence in court. Moreover, the evidence must follow section 90A of Evidence Act 1950 (Act 56) such as the evidence must not be tampered or altered with to make it admissible in court. The safety applications also must abide the requirements, for instance, the device in which the evidence is produced must be in good condition as stated in section 90A of Evidence Act 1950. However, in 20 safety applications that have been analysed, only 6 applications (30%) provide emergency recording. 

Most of the applications only have in-app recording to make reports. While in-app recording is useful, during emergencies, users will feel scared and traumatised not be able to think much during incident such as robbery (Victim Support, 2023) and they will tend to forget to record it. Lack of admissible evidence may cause the case reported to be no further action (NFA) or the evidence cannot be used in court. For example, during case of PP v Ayub Khan bin Ismail in 2012, there is an evidence found that some photos taken earlier had been deleted from the camera and caused the evidence to be rejected by court. 

This will be injustice for the victim which most likely has suffer stress symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (Montani, 2020). If automatic recording is still not being a standard requirement for safety applications, many crime can happened without any action taken. Ultimately, safety applications should provide tools that record evidence on the go and can be stored in a secured place.


**1.2.2 No easily accessible panic button in exisiting safety applications.**

Panic button should be easily accessible as it is an emergency feature. Developer should make widget or lock screen shortcut to make it easier for user to reach. When in panic, our brain cannot think straight and make it hard to give full information about the situation. According to Chu et al. (2022), during a stressful situation the nervous system will trigger fight or flight response. The panic will increase our adrenaline and turn our body to focus on fighting or running away from the situation. 

During situations that require quick thinking, if applications do not have easily accessible panic button, users need to open the applications and wait for it to load. However, based on the application analysis, only 1 out of 20 applications (5%) has panic button that is easily access either as a widget on homescreen or from lock screen. Lack of informations will caused us problem when lodging police report. According to the Official Portal of Royal Malaysia Police (n.d.), when lodging a police report, we need to include important information in the report. We need to mention what, when, where, who and how the incident happened. We also need to tell the police officer what the incident has caused such as losses and injuries. However, in the case of panic, we may not remember most of the details. This will risk the user in danger and slow down the process of information sharing. All other 19 applications require the user to open the applications and press the button on their interface. Some applications do not even make the panic button visible and we need to find them. 

If this continue to happen in future development of safety applications, many users will not have enough time to press panic button while panicking at the same time. Without such informations, the authorities cannot understand the situation and they may come underprepared. They also would not be able to pinpoint our exact location which will make it hard for them to help us. The criminal will be able to notice we are calling for help and take away the smartphone before we be able to do anything. Thus, easily accessible panic button is a must in safety application.

**1.2.3 Existing safety applications do not alert users about dangerous spots in the city.**

Alerting user about dangerous spots around the area should be compulsary for safety applications. User must be alert when there is dangerous spot nearby them. For people that are still new in the city, they do not know which area is dangerous to wander around, especially during the night. They might just go through the area according to their maps application without knowing the area has a lot of cases. Thus, people will not prepare for situations such as walking alone or bringing their children along. In spite of that, 15 out of 20 applications (75%) do not alert users or provide features of showing dangerous spots around the city. For tourists or citizens that just moved to Malacca City, they may not be told beforehand about dangerous spots around the city.

Based on Population And Housing Census Of Malaysia of Malacca state, published by Department of Statistic Malaysia (DOSM) (2020), Central Malacca consists of Malacca City with the highest population has 200 cases of violent crime that includes murder, rape and robbery. It is the highest compared to Jasin and Alor Gajah with 43 and 68 cases respectively. Moreover, for property crime that includes theft and robbery, Central Malacca has 699 cases while Jasin and Alor Gajah have 119 and 181 respectively. 

These statistics show that the city has higher crime rates compared to other areas. They may walk around areas with many recent cases such as pickpocketing without being aware of their safety. If the problem is not solved, many tourists and citizen may go to the dangerous spots and crime cases may increase from year to year. Therefore, dangerous spots alert must be implemented to make sure users are aware of risk before they go near the spots.

### 1.3 Objectives

a) To design and develop Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App using geofencing and geotagging.

b) To evaluate the accuracy of geofencing and geotagging on Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App using geolocation testing tool.

### 1.4 Project scope

**1.4.1 Location**

The Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will be used in Malacca City which is the capital city of Malacca. The capital city covers 307.86 square kilometers and consists of famous city spots such as A Famosa and Dataran Pahlawan. These areas with a lot of tourists can be dangerous especially during the night. Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will be most helpful when unwanted things happen.

**1.4.2 Users**

Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will benefit anyone inside Malacca City. Users can add trusted family and friends. Only trusted persons are allowed to see current location and location history.

**1.4.3 Technology**

Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App is using geofencing, geolocation and geotagging to track user. Geofencing services to alert user of any incidents or weather change nearby. Geolocation services to track user’s location in real-time. Geotagging to attach geographic coordinates to photos and videos.

**1.4.4 Mode**

Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app is online but can be used offline with limited functionality which is offline maps and panic button.

**1.4.5 Functionality**

One of the functionality of Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app is to track and locate users. Users may add any trusted family or friends into Circles, which then the user can allow to track and locate. Only Circles members can see the real-time location of the user on the map. The app also will check in the location for a certain time set up by the user. For example, for every 10 minutes, the app will check in and show the location on location history.

Secondly, the panic button. When activated, the app will alert Circles members and nearby user that the owner is in danger. Loud sounds will also be played to attract attention. Automatic recording will start and upload the recording to Circles if there is Internet connection. Circles members also will get a message containing essential information such as coordinate location. In the event of no Internet connection, the recording will be saved inside the device and a SMS will be sent to Circles.

Next, we can report areas with many cases such as robbery, pickpocket and road obstruction. The reported areas will show up as hotspot areas if enough reports are received. Reported areas will appear on the map to alert users.

Other than that, the app has a built-in map that shows authorities nearby, for example police stations, in case of emergency. It also shows hotspot areas nearby. Hotspot area is an area where many cases were reported by users. For instance, robbery. Circles members location will also be shown and users can get directions to go to them. For offline mode, only downloaded parts of the maps will be shown.

Lastly, the user will receive push notification for weather and incident alert. Whenever the forecast for the city is bad, such as thunderstorm, the app will give notification. Then, if the reported cases are classified as dangerous, nearby user will be alerted and the application will provide safety tips based on the situation.

### Project Significance

**1.5.1 Automatic video recording with anto-tempering implementation during emergency**

Integrating video recording feature that enhances user security during emergency. The feature is activated automatically when the user activates the panic button to make sure the evidence is available. Video recorded will be stored in the device and will be uploaded to a trusted person if an Internet connection is available. Moreover, the video will show timestamps and additional information such as coordinates. The file will be encrypted to make sure it can not be tampered to make it admissible for court evidence. 

**1.5.2 Essential information will be send to trusted person and user nearby when easily accessible ‘Panic Button’ activated**

User does not need to open the application to use the panic button. The Waspada application offers a panic button as a widget on their homescreen for quicker access to the panic button. Lock screen shortcut also available if they prefer to access the panic button without unlocking their phone. This feature will reduce the time to call for help and increase the chance of surviving.  

Information is crucial when lodging report, especially for cases involving crime. When the panic button is activated, the Waspada app will push notification alerts consisting of date & time and location coordinates to trusted persons and users nearby. The information will make the rescuing by authorities more efficient as the details already provided. The feature ensures the essential information reaches the right people for better efficiency during critical situations. Victim does not need to worry about saving themselves.

**1.5.3 Maps shows real-time potentially dangerous cases with alert using geofencing**

Waspada app real-time reported cases map integrated with geolocation with user contribution by reporting incidents directly through the app. Geotagging ensures precise incident mapping while the maps show reported cases in real-time with its category such as harassment or abduction. The alert system makes users more aware by notifying the user when they are near  a hotspot area. Users can upvote the report or report it as a false alarm. The feature promotes  user safety by planning their activity while avoiding the hotspot area.
