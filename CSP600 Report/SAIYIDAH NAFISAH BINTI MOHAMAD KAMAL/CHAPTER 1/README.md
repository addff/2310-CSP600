## Project Background

E-Management is a digital application that allows teachers to easily update and maintain all information within the application. It also enables parents to monitor their child's progress and access new information about kindergarten activities through their smartphones. E-management is a functional and organizational structure that is adaptable, transparent and communicates its impacts with surroundings both inside and outside the company (Huthaifa et al. 2013). According to Hashim et al (2010), an E-management system is made to effectively handle a variety of macro and micro-operations. Other than that, it is a strategic method for leading dynamic, forward-thinking companies by putting in place a high-performance and technology-driven framework (Yao et al. 2011)

Kindergarten is an institution for early ages, starting from four years old until six years old. The institution will provide for early learning and socialization and prepare them for their educational journey. According to Ackerman et al (2005), these programs focusing on the growth and well-being of kids are essential to lowering the proportion of kids in danger of not finishing school. The goal of promoting preparedness is to broaden access to superior center-based. All three and four-year-old low-income children should get early childhood education. Therefore, the project's objective is to develop a methodical system for the kindergarten's management.

Authentication is one of the ways to protect the data in a database from any unauthorized action from outsiders. In the context of information technology and computer security, authentication is the act of confirming that a person, system, or other entity is who they say they are before allowing access to a system, application, or piece of data. One of the most important problems in the field of information systems is developing an authentication method based on the automation of identities required to get access to the network with enough trust. (Mohammed,2013). According to Hadi et al (2019) According to the information system's security criteria, authentication's objective is to confirm an entity's identification with recognized threshold trust.

This project will be conducted in collaboration with a chosen stakeholder. The chosen stakeholder is Anje International Quranic Preschool, located in Nilai, Negeri Sembilan. The preschool comprises 4 teachers, 3 staff members, and 15 students.

This project will develop a mobile application that utilizes online mode to ensure continuous data synchronization and effective real-time communication between teachers and parents. Teachers may effortlessly and problem-free update all student data and activities by utilizing this system. For instance, teachers no longer need to write things down on paper when working with their phones or tablets. Aside from that, parents can see their children's growth in education and they can contact teachers if they have any concerns about their performance by utilizing this method.
