## Project Background

E-Management is a digital application that allows teachers to easily update and maintain all information within the application. It also enables parents to monitor their child's progress and access new information about kindergarten activities through their smartphones. E-management is a functional and organizational structure that is adaptable, transparent and communicates its impacts with surroundings both inside and outside the company (Huthaifa et al. 2013). According to Hashim et al (2010), an E-management system is made to effectively handle a variety of macro and micro-operations. Other than that, it is a strategic method for leading dynamic, forward-thinking companies by putting in place a high-performance and technology-driven framework (Yao et al. 2011)

Kindergarten is an institution for early ages, starting from four years old until six years old. The institution will provide for early learning and socialization and prepare them for their educational journey. According to Ackerman et al (2005), these programs focusing on the growth and well-being of kids are essential to lowering the proportion of kids in danger of not finishing school. The goal of promoting preparedness is to broaden access to superior center-based. All three and four-year-old low-income children should get early childhood education. Therefore, the project's objective is to develop a methodical system for the kindergarten's management.

Authentication is one of the ways to protect the data in a database from any unauthorized action from outsiders. In the context of information technology and computer security, authentication is the act of confirming that a person, system, or other entity is who they say they are before allowing access to a system, application, or piece of data. One of the most important problems in the field of information systems is developing an authentication method based on the automation of identities required to get access to the network with enough trust. (Mohammed,2013). According to Hadi et al (2019) According to the information system's security criteria, authentication's objective is to confirm an entity's identification with recognized threshold trust.

This project will be conducted in collaboration with a chosen stakeholder. The chosen stakeholder is Anje International Quranic Preschool, located in Nilai, Negeri Sembilan. The preschool comprises 4 teachers, 3 staff members, and 15 students.

This project will develop a mobile application that utilizes online mode to ensure continuous data synchronization and effective real-time communication between teachers and parents. Teachers may effortlessly and problem-free update all student data and activities by utilizing this system. For instance, teachers no longer need to write things down on paper when working with their phones or tablets. Aside from that, parents can see their children's growth in education and they can contact teachers if they have any concerns about their performance by utilizing this method.

## Problem Statement


Ideal interaction between teachers and parents is crucial, fostering clear and effective communication to prevent misunderstandings. This is particularly important in addressing the challenges and barriers that may arise during interactions among educators, parents, and children in a classroom setting. These obstacles can hinder efficient communication and teamwork, potentially impacting the quality of the educational experience

### 1.Interaction challenges between all participants in the educational process
The interaction between admin, teachers and parents should be ideal and they should have better communication between them to avoid any misunderstanding. Related to the challenges and barriers that may appear during interactions between educators, parents, and children in a classroom setting. A good educational experience might be hampered by these obstacles to efficient communication and teamwork. However, the current situation at Anje International Quranic Preschool is not like supposed to be. Although the kindergarten has a relatively online communication system such as the WhatsApp application, sometimes communication with parents and teachers is quite difficult considering some parents still choose a conventional and somewhat less flexible way with applied changes. This may result in delays in the delivery of important information and responses received. 


### 2.Accessibility of student data and information is not secure and all records are not well-organized

Data information within all organizations must be well-organized and readily available at all times. This is essential to prevent data loss or corruption. Additionally, data should be secured through measures such as the implementation of encryption, access controls, and authentication processes to protect student data. However, at Anje International Quranic Preschool, things are not going as they should be right now. For now, Anje International Quranic Preschool obtaining the necessary information by using a manual way which may take a while, particularly if the data is physically dispersed over several files. This may interfere with making decisions quickly. Other than that, every record is disorganized indicating a deficiency in efficient data management and organization techniques. Accurate student records may be difficult to retrieve, update, and manage as a result of this disarray.




## Objective
1. To design the kindergarten management system for Anje International Quranic Preschool to make a systematic and centralized system
2. To develop a mobile application kindergarten management system for Anje International Quranic Preschool using authentication for securing data management.
3. To evaluate the mobile application kindergarten management system for Anje International Quranic Preschool using user acceptance testing and functionality testing
