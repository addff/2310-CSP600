## Dream Wedding: Mobile Application for Wedding Organizer Assistant using Geolocation

### 1.1 Project Background
In the fast-paced world of today, it can be difficult and time-consuming to arrange a wedding.  One of the biggest and most memorable occasions in a person's life is the day of marriage (ESGS & Adhari, 2022). However, with so many different duties, deadlines, and vendor collaboration, wedding planning may be a challenging matter. Many times, couples find it too much to handle when it comes to planning every little thing, from choosing the ideal location to coordinating with different vendors.

A wedding organizer is a service that helps in the preparation and execution of the wedding event (Ayu & Fitri, 2019). A wedding organizer, often referred to as a wedding planner or wedding coordinator, is a professional who specializes in planning and managing weddings. Their main responsibility is to help couples plan and carry out the wedding day, making sure everything goes as planned and the couple's vision is realized. Various types of services are available from wedding organizers based on the requirements and preferences of the client.

A mobile application is an application created especially for mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, that is customized for a certain mobile operating system, such as iOS or Android. Numerous purposes are fulfilled by these applications, which range from social networking sites and gaming software to productivity tools and entertainment programs with touchscreen-friendly interfaces. App developers often make updates to enhance functionality and add new features, and users download these programs from official app stores. Users may find it more challenging to choose which applications to install and use as a result of this expansion, especially those who are not knowledgeable about technology. For developers, ensuring that their mobile applications will be profitable and widely used is far more challenging (Abulhaija et al., 2022). In addition to working online or offline and interacting with the device's hardware and sensors, mobile apps can be paid for with in-app purchases, subscriptions, advertising, or other in-app purchases. Since they improve the functionality of mobile devices and satisfy a variety of user demands and preferences, they have become essential to modern life.

Geolocation is the method and technology used to determine or estimate an object's actual geographic location, such as that of a computer, smartphone, or other internet-connected device. It uses a variety of technologies to pinpoint the exact latitude and longitude coordinates of the device, including Wi-Fi, cellular networks, IP addresses, and the GPS (Global Positioning System). Numerous services and applications use geolocation extensively to enable location-based features including local search, mapping, navigation, and personalized content delivery (Zheng, Xie, Ma, & Ma, 2019). For instance, apps and services can offer personalised experiences, including location-specific recommendations, local search results, and targeted advertisements, by using geolocation. Being an essential part of the current digital technologies, it has transformed businesses by enabling location-based marketing strategies, improving user experiences, and promoting the development of location-aware applications that adapt dynamically to users' changes in locations.
  
### 1.2 Problem Statement
Based on the survey findings, three significant problem statements have emerged concerning wedding organizers.

1.2.1 Difficult to compare different wedding organizers and their services.

Clients may find it difficult to compare various wedding organizers and the services they provide for a variety of reasons. Nowadays, wedding organizers promote their services on a variety of online platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This implies that to acquire information more about different organizers, clients must browse through a variety of websites, social media accounts, and online listings. Because of that, clients may find it challenging to centralize and standardize the data they gather from various sources due to the wide array of platforms. Direct comparisons can be difficult because each platform may display information in a somewhat different format. However, clients are also faced with a dilemma because of this abundance of choices. Selecting the venue for the wedding is a difficult task because there are a lot of things to take into consideration, such as the expected bride and groom's schedule and budget (Wibowo & Priandika, 2021). Therefore, to discover the organizer that best suits their demands and budget, they will need to put in a lot of time and effort exploring and browsing through several platforms. Almost three-quarters of those responding to the survey (73.3%) agreed with the statement. It indicates that some people might find it challenging to efficiently navigate different online platforms to discover more about various wedding organizers, which would make it difficult for them to make wise comparisons.

A filtering and sorting system could be put in place to greatly help with this problem. 
Dream Wedding will allow users to refine their search using key factors consisting of location, services provided, price range, and user ratings, such a system would enable users to speed up their search. Dream Wedding mobile application would also improve this system's accessibility and convenience. Using a user-friendly interface, this application could act as a centralized platform where different wedding organizers can list all their services, packages, and prices. This would allow clients to compare and select the ideal wedding organizer based on their requirements and preferences. These alternatives would make comparing vendors easier while also giving people looking for wedding organizing assistance a more effective and user-friendly experience.
   
1.2.2 The difficulty in discerning dates that have already been reserved by other clients.

The problem is that it can be hard to find dates that other clients have already reserved. To make a reservation, potential clients must presently come in person to the organizer's office. But once they get there, they frequently discover that someone else already secured the desired date, which wastes their time. The fact that many clients work during the day as well as at night and have hectic schedules makes it difficult for them to physically visit the office, which adds to the inconvenience. Consequently, the existing booking process wastes time and burdens clients because they can't simply check the availability of dates without going to the organizer's office. This requires the development of a more accessible and efficient booking system. According to the survey, around 80 percent of those who took the survey agreed that it is difficult for them to find out if certain dates have already been reserved by someone else. This challenge is caused by the requirement that reservations be made in person at the organizer's office.

It becomes essential to implement a digital solution in regards to the issues raised in the survey. Potential clients can quickly check the dates online without having to physically visit each organizer's office by creating an availability calendar that shows both booked and available dates. Moreover, Dream Wedding incorporating an easy-to-use booking system with options for selecting a date and time would greatly improve the process of booking. Customers would benefit from increased transparency as well as the ability to make well-informed booking decisions from the comfort of their homes or places of business, which would accommodate their busy schedules.

1.2.3 Experiencing difficulties in contacting wedding organizers through existing online platforms.

Having trouble getting in touch with wedding planners via the variety of online digital platforms that are currently in use refers to the problems clients encounter when attempting to get in touch with wedding organizing experts. These problems can include unclear communication channels, uncooperative organizers, delayed answers, and technical difficulties with the platforms. Clients who are looking for fast and effective communication to talk about their wedding decisions, ask questions, or get clarification on specifics about the services provided may become frustrated as a result of these challenges. Essentially, the issue revolves on how difficult it is for clients to communicate with wedding planners online due to the ineffectiveness or inefficiency of the online interactions methods offered by these platforms. According to the survey, 54.7% of those who took the survey acknowledged that contacting wedding organizers via current online medium shows difficulties. This percentage shows that a significant number of the respondents had trouble communicating. These difficulties could manifest as unclear communication channels, unresponsiveness, or delayed responses.

The implementation of a robust chat system is considered important to solving the challenges raised by the survey. Through the integration of a smooth and effective chat interface within the mobile application, clients are able to interact with wedding organizers directly, free from any delays or unclear platforms. Real-time communication is ensured by this solution, giving customers the ability to discuss specifics, ask questions, and get immediate answers which will greatly enhance their experience. A feature like this increases customer satisfaction through enabling direct communication and creating an easy-to-use open medium. Ultimately, implementation of this effective chat system would minimize the distance between clients and the wedding organizers, offering an user-friendly platform for efficient and immediate communication, thus resolving the issues with the current online platforms.
